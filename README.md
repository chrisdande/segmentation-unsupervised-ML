# segmentation-unsupervised-ML
I performed an Unsupervised Machine Learning Model (K Means) and Generate Insights that will ADD VALUE to the business. I used  Python to run my  Machine Learning model and optimize it and then deployed the results in Power BI.
## Stage for this project

1. Problem formulation - What are we trying to solve?
2. Explaining how the whole automated process will work (Excel - CSV - Python - CSV - Power BI)
3. Loading the Raw Data into Python
4. Cleaning the Raw Data
5. Performed Kmeans clustering using SKLean
6. How to run Kmeans clustering using SKLean
7. Ran Kmeans and  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) together in Python to improve result.
8. Ran Kmeans with optimal parameters
9. Save and deployed my output to Power BI
10. Created the front end PowerBI Dashboard (2nd file -Power BI reporting)
11. Created Insights from Clusters (2nd file -Power BI reporting)
